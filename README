git://github.com/hitz/eclipse-tteditor.git

This is a full source code release, because at least that way you can change the colors (see the file ITTColorConstants.java).  You are on your own rebuilding the .jar however!

use the command 
prompt> git clone git://github.com/hitz/eclipse-tteditor.git

cp tteditor_1.0.0.201006110828.jar /Your/Eclipse/InstallationDir/plugins

It's set up to recognize files with extension .tt2 and .tmpl.  I am pretty sure there is some way to set this from Eclipse preferences.

KNOWN BUGS:
- HTML/XML comments marked with <!-- --> are suppose to be brick red. They are instead black.  This looks fine so I didn't fix it.  TT comments are brick red (correct).
- quoted strings inside [% %] also appear as black text, but this also looks fine, so I didn't fix it.


If you have trouble with git and just want the .jar, send an email and I will put it up somewhere else.

Please send bug reports to: hitz@genome.stanford.edu.  Don't expect them to be fixed promptly!  

Feel free to steal/abuse/modify/incorporate this "code" into your own work, private or commercial as you see fit.
I or Stanford University is not responsible for any damages.
